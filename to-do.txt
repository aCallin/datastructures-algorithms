To do:
    [ BACKLOG ]
    - algorithms:
        - huffman encoding (not bad)
        - KMP algorithm (not bad actually)
        - sorts:
            - merge sort
            - bucket sort
            - radix sort
            - something for the linked list
        - dynamic programming:
            - longest common subsequence
    - data structures:
        - graphs
            - depth first search
            - breadth first search
            - topological sorting (acyclic graph, at least 1 node with in-degree 0)
            - max flow
            - all pair shortest paths (just call single source shortest paths V times and return table of tables)
        - disjoint sets
        - red black tree
        - hash table
    - other:
        - convert min/max heap combo into just a min heap (maybe with decreaseKey supported too)
        - comment graph.h
        - fix up dijkstra's algorithm
